# ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database

The ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II combines sets of objective indoor
environmental measurements with accompanying "right-here-right-now" subjective evaluations
by occupants from buildings around the world. The database is intended to support diverse
inquiries about thermal comfort in field settings. This is the official repository which
contains the code used to maintain the Database II from version 2.1 onward. You can
download the latest version of the database
from [here](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.6078/D1F671).

This repository contains the source code we used to generate each new version of the
dataset. This allows you to track the changes we have implemented. We encourage you to
submit an issue if you spot any errors or you would like us to implement some changes. The
repository comprises different folders, each containing the source code and data we used
to generate a new version of the database.

## Contributing

You can contribute to the project by sending us your dataset. Please clean and collate the
data into a single .csv file that matches the existing DBII structure outlined. This
simple [web tool](https://databaseqc.shinyapps.io/submission/) will help error check and
format the data. It also has a downloadable .csv template file. Note that this tool
reflects the old database format - we will work to update the tool soon.

### Reporting issues

## Changelog

### Version 2.1

This is the first major update to the ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II since it
was published in 2018. In the time since release, it has been used by hundreds of
researchers who have found errors and requested new features. This update aims to address
some of those while improving operability with other resources. As a result, there are
breaking changes.

The major updates to the database are:

1. 6,566 new records from field studies in India, Malaysia, Italy, Japan, Indonesia,
   Singapore, and Cyprus. Thanks to Hasim Altan (Arkin University of Creative Arts and
   Design), Siti Aisyah Damiati (University of Adelaide), Harimi Djamila (Universiti
   Malaysia Sabah), Jeetika Malik (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory), Bertug
   Ozarisoy (University of East London), Elisabetta Maria Patane (University of Bath), and
   Rajan Rawal (CEPT University) for kindly sharing their data with the community.
2. Improvements to the meteorological data. In the earlier version of the database, the
   source and quality of the meteorological data was unclear in some cases. We now use the
   NOAA Integrated Surface Database (ISD) for meteorological data where possible. Thanks
   to Peixian Li (Tongji University) for adding the timestamps from the original
   datasets (where available). Meteorological data from either the original dataset or the
   ISD are now included along with the relevant metadata.
3. The database is now split into a metadata table and a measurements table. This should
   make working with the full dataset quicker and easier due to smaller file sizes and new
   fields in the metadata table.

There are many other changes included in this update. The full change log is below:
